No questions asked, he opened a binance account and deposited his first $ 500 from a savings account. After a little bit of  Binance, he discovered the Futures feature. He watched a few videos on YT and found that leverage trading is a very good idea and why everyone doesn't do it if it brings such income. Setting the highest possible gear, he bought BTC for long. I remember when I was bombed with messages why I didn't tell him about this feature. It turned out that his position was liquidated within 5 minutes and he lost everything. I have a bad feeling of guilt for persuading him to do crypto. Since then, I don't talk to anyone about crypto, except crypto communities . \n\n*PS: My friend is doing fine, he bounced off the bottom.*\n\nSo tell me anything, I'm curious.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rawl8l/tell_me_your_bestworst_crypto_experiences/

No questions asked, he opened a binance account and deposited his first $ 500 from a savings account. After a little bit of  Binance, he discovered the Futures feature. He watched a few videos on YT and found that leverage trading is a very good idea and why everyone doesn't do it if it brings such income. Setting the highest possible gear, he bought BTC for long. I remember when I was bombed with messages why I didn't tell him about this feature. It turned out that his position was liquidated within 5 minutes and he lost everything. I have a bad feeling of guilt for persuading him to do crypto. Since then, I don't talk to anyone about crypto, except crypto communities . \n\n*PS: My friend is doing fine, he bounced off the bottom.*\n\nSo tell me anything, I'm curious.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rawl8l/tell_me_your_bestworst_crypto_experiences/

This thread is a beta of a weekly Monero community altcoin discussion thread. \n\nIn this thread, sidebar rule #3 only applies to ledger forks. If you have a policy suggestion (rules or structure that you think would be good to add for future Altcoin Saturday threads), send a message to the subreddit moderators, and we will look into integrating it. In the spirit of decentralization, tentative policy changes will be proposed to the community for discussion via a stickied comment.",https://www.reddit.com/r/xmrtrader/comments/r8kuh4/weekly_discussion_altcoin_saturday_december_04/
