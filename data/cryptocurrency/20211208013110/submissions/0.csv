No questions asked, he opened a binance account and deposited his first $ 500 from a savings account. After a little bit of  Binance, he discovered the Futures feature. He watched a few videos on YT and found that leverage trading is a very good idea and why everyone doesn't do it if it brings such income. Setting the highest possible gear, he bought BTC for long. I remember when I was bombed with messages why I didn't tell him about this feature. It turned out that his position was liquidated within 5 minutes and he lost everything. I have a bad feeling of guilt for persuading him to do crypto. Since then, I don't talk to anyone about crypto, except crypto communities . \n\n*PS: My friend is doing fine, he bounced off the bottom.*\n\nSo tell me anything, I'm curious.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rawl8l/tell_me_your_bestworst_crypto_experiences/
