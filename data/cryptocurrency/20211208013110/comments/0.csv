Hypothetically, if you can generate more than 8% a year, you can make more money, while keeping your long term assets after.

hnky81f,raw8k9,"I mean, when you look at trade volume, XMR isn't even 1% of binance's total volume, not even close. And you'd have to assume that most likely, most of that is real.\n\nSo what you're effectively saying is you think Binance is risking completely screwing themselves over with fraud allegations and criminal prosecution, all so they can gain maybe an extra 0.0001% of their total revenue from fraud on XMR?\n\nDo you really believe they're stupid enough to do this?",1638876331,t1_hnkxzz4,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/raw8k9/what_would_happen_if_people_started_withdrawing/hnky81f/
hnkyvew,raw8k9,"Yes I actually do, even if I sound crazy or stupid. Worst case scenario for them is they have to delay the withdrawals make some excuse and buy XMR at higher price than they ""sold"" it for. If they are lucky, they have to buy it at lower price.\n\nThis is a billionaire dance club, do you think they don't do some dirty work if the risk is this low?",1638876815,t1_hnky81f,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/raw8k9/what_would_happen_if_people_started_withdrawing/hnkyvew/
