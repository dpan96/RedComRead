r8kuh4,1638604877,"[Weekly Discussion] Altcoin Saturday â€“ December 04, 2021","Many people respect the arguments and views put forth by the Monero community, and have requested an official place where altcoins can be discussed. This thread is a beta of a weekly Monero community altcoin discussion thread. \n\nIn this thread, sidebar rule #3 only applies to ledger forks. If you have a policy suggestion (rules or structure that you think would be good to add for future Altcoin Saturday threads), send a message to the subreddit moderators, and we will look into integrating it. In the spirit of decentralization, tentative policy changes will be proposed to the community for discussion via a stickied comment.",https://www.reddit.com/r/xmrtrader/comments/r8kuh4/weekly_discussion_altcoin_saturday_december_04/
