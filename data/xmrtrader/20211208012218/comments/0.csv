Right now if I want to buy or sell XMR, I have to go to Kraken, sell my XMR, send a request for SEPA, wait for 1-3 days for the fiat to arrive to my account and then I can go buy groceries. With a CBDC EUR I will go to Kraken, sell my XMR, transfer to CBDC EUR and within 10 seconds or less I will be able to buy groceries. Similar for the other way around, buying XMR via Kraken is going to take a few minutes vs a few days it takes now.

CBDCs are also probably going to be smart-contractable.\n\nIt is like going from an old horse-and-carriage road to a 3-lane highway.

hmxid3j,r72f1z,"Well written article; although it does not specifically name Monero as a risk to public safety.\n\nHere's the full text on that section.  \n\n\n>Taking into account the above findings, instead of going after privacy-blockchains communities’ members to punish them, these tools should be, in my opinion, directed against privacy-cryptocurrency that creates ML/FT risks which cannot be overcome using any available approaches. The focus should be on the direct source of risk to public safety, not on the people which create that risk. An analogy to the off-chain world is where enforcement law agencies directly targeted the building constructed in violation of building regulation, and destroyed it rather than—or in addition to—targeting people responsible for the building’s construction. The ultimate aim of new tools in the blockchain space should be to reduce the economic value of the outlawed native cryptocurrency whose value drives the operation of a given platform, in particular by reducing trust in the stability and security of the network. If effective, means that reduce the value of the cryptocurrency will therefore reduce the number of the network’s users and nodes. The decreasing number of users and nodes (and thus the decreasing infrastructural and political decentralization \[66\]) should automatically reduce blockchain security. \n\nBut as you say, effectively it is calling out XMR as we know that BTC and ZCash are significantly less effective private currencies.  \n\n\nCBDCs will be the biggest risk to public safety and deserve to be publicly attacked.",1638452829,t1_hmwsf88,/r/xmrtrader/comments/r72f1z/daily_discussion_thursday_december_2/hmxid3j/

I think it's a good thing to create this routine to buy an undisclosed amount every month, at the same day. It could be thousands of dollars, or it could be just five bucks. It's a good habit to develop, because you're making sure your **worked time** is not being stolen from you by parking it on fiat currencies that are devalued every month.\n\nMonero might not be the most pumped coin out there. But its monetary policy is solid and you don't need to worry about prying eyes who will absolutely track your finances. I mean, everyone is talking about how blockchain analytics is good.\n\nWhy would it be good? Think, my dear friend.\n\nMonero sounds pretty good now doesn't it?\n\nYou also get the added *good feeling* of contributing for it to raise in price when valued in fiat, which is honestly kinda pointless in my opinion but I guess it does make people feel good.\n\nSo hey, anyone who wants to join me on this buying event, which I'm fairly sure is novel and no one thought about it before, then feel free to join the party! Just throw some dollars on monero and make sure you're leaving less of the supply available to laggards and shorters.\n\nAnd don't forget to withdraw the monero to your wallet.

I think it's a good thing that exchanges are delisting it.\n\nIt's worth noting that XMR is one of the few cryptos that holds its value due to real world use, as opposed to simply investing for growth.\n\nIn cryptocurrency terms, the price of Monero has been relatively stable for a long time. This makes it a good place to store your wealth.\n\nTraders can easily make money from grid trading XMR by buying near $200 and shorting near $400. The price action of this coin is very predictable and as you zoom into the time frames you can take shorter scalping plays. It's also pretty cool that the price action looks like loads of Monero M logos on the chart.\n\nI don't want XMR to go up in price. However, I imagine the next generation of youth (Gen A) will most likely see privacy as something that's cool and edgey. The world in 30 years time will be one of restricted and extremely limited resources and government intervention. It's this world where privacy coins will thrive. They will be a future version of cash in hand payments. People will be using monero to trade energy, water and other black market commodities.\n\nToday, fuel and electricity in my country (the UK) is already becoming unaffordable and black market economies are already starting to spring up. You can buy illegal fuel using cash but cash is on its way out.

hmoapqs,r5iaiv,">Today, fuel and electricity in my country (the UK) is already becoming unaffordable and black market economies are already starting to spring up. You can buy illegal fuel using cash but cash is on its way out. It's a given that XMR will replace it.\n\nMy thesis since the beginning. Free markets are the only markets capable of economic calculation and coordinating economic activity. As we have seen in every other collectivist revolution, as the government distortions in the economy grow in magnitude, economic activity moves to the shadow markets where calculation and coordination is possible. Shadow markets are already ~20% of global GDP and growing.\n\n>Now it makes perfect sense for the government to let the black market grow. This becomes a source of income for military groups and also prevents a political breakdown\n\nIn a classic example, Venezuela instituted price controls on gasoline, which resulted in severe shortages and members of the military selling gasoline on the black market.",1638287708,t1_hmno6nr,/r/xmrtrader/comments/r5iaiv/daily_discussion_tuesday_november_30/hmoapqs/
