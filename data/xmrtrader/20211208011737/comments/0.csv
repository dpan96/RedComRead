Right now if I want to buy or sell XMR, I have to go to Kraken, sell my XMR, send a request for SEPA, wait for 1-3 days for the fiat to arrive to my account and then I can go buy groceries. With a CBDC EUR I will go to Kraken, sell my XMR, transfer to CBDC EUR and within 10 seconds or less I will be able to buy groceries. Similar for the other way around, buying XMR via Kraken is going to take a few minutes vs a few days it takes now.

CBDCs are also probably going to be smart-contractable.\n\nIt is like going from an old horse-and-carriage road to a 3-lane highway.

hnbwe2v,r9avb0,"Hello Mr. Chu,\n\n    I wouldn't say they were incompetent. Upon further reflection I'd say if Tether crashed it would most likely be due to an exit scam of some sort perpetrated by those with the access and capability to do so. If they didn't intend to crash then I don't believe it would happen. I've also noticed how they've been fined and forbidden to do business in New York state. That's no small problem. I also find it interesting how they were able to convince people, myself included, for so long that it was actually backed by the US dollar when in fact it's not.

hnft8qv,r9avb0,I came to the same conclusion. It's not good business practice to do so and any viable company that intends on staying in the black would diversify thier commercial paper. The Crypto atmosphere is something else than I'm used to. Any public corporation with shareholders would never dare behave so negligently. It's quite the odd feeling to discuss such. In traditional markets this type of thing wouldn't even be on the playing field.\n\n\nEdit:\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-10-07/crypto-mystery-where-s-the-69-billion-backing-the-stablecoin-tether\n\nFascinating,1638780679,t1_hnfsokv,/r/xmrtrader/comments/r9avb0/daily_discussion_sunday_december_5/hnft8qv/

hnbl9q5,r9avb0,"In two words, it's because transactions refernce their ring members by offsets. If there's a reorg, these offsets change and make most transactions in reorganized blocks invalid. This is why there's a 10 block limit - transactions always use ring members 10 blocks or older to avoid this problem. It's possible to reference other transactions by hashes, not offsets and then there's not reason to have 10 block limit.",1638711294,t1_hnbfh0x,/r/xmrtrader/comments/r9avb0/daily_discussion_sunday_december_5/hnbl9q5/
